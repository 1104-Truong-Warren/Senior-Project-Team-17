  - Good work!
  - Now, let's control the mech itself.
  - At the bottom of your screen is the action menu.
  - During your turn, this menu will appear and show you your available combat options.
  - Clicking the "move" button will enable movement mode, and you can select a spot
    to move to.
  - You can also press the 'M' key on your keyboard to enable movement.
  - Under normal conditions, you get two actions per turn.
  - You can only move a limited number of spaces. For now, this is 6 spaces.
  - However, you may also choose to use your second action to move a little bit further.
  - Let's try it now.
